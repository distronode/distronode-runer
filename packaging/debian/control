Description: interfaces with Distronode from other systems (Python 2)
 A tool and python library that helps when interfacing with Distronode
 directly or as part of another system whether that be through a
 container image interface, as a standalone tool, or as a Python
 module that can be imported. The goal is to provide a stable and
 consistent interface abstraction to Distronode.
